Lab Log is a web-app designed using flask(a web-designing library of python) and jinja templating.
It allows students to login and check their weekly progress, syllabus, reminders and study material.
Teachers can login and upload students' attendance, marks and to-do lists.
Teachers can also put up interesting posts on the timeline of students about state-of-the-art technologies!
This web-app has properly validated registration and login forms to allow only authenticated access.
